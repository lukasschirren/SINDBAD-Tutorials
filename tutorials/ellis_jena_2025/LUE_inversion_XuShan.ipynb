    "## SINDBAD\n",
    "[SINDBAD](http://sindbad-mdi.org/) is a model-data integration framework for terrestrial carbon-water processes [[Koirala et al., in prep.](https://essopenarchive.org/users/551954/articles/1271244)]. Is built in Julia with a view on speed and differenciability for the development of representation of processes and responses of ecosystem functioning to meteorological conditions and changes in climate. Sets on the concept of modularity to formaly test hypothesis on the representation of processes / models ($f(X,\\theta)$), for given observational constraints ($Y$) and drivers ($X$) of the carbon and water dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. Modularity is extended to the initial condition problem ($\\text{x}^*_0$), cost functions ($\\mathcal{L(\\theta)}$) and optimization algorithms ($\\mathcal{O}$). SINDBAD integrates machine learning for enhancing the representation of processes in mechanistically-inspired models, hybrid modeling [Reichstein et al., 2019], by learning ML-based parameterizations [e.g. Bao et al., 2024], paving way for process abstraction [Son et al., 2024].\n",
